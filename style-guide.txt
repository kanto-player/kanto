VHDL Style Guide
============
 - Use four-space indents
 - No hard tabs
 - Name entities under major subsystems with a prefix for that subsystem
   in order to prevent naming conflicts. (e.g., everything under audio buffer
   subsystem is prefixed with ab_).
 - First signal in port declaration on same line as "port (".
 - Final signal in port declaration on same line as final ");".
 - Do not leave commented out code in your commits, just delete them.
   That's what version control is for.
